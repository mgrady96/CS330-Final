**How do I approach designing software?**<br />
The way that I approach designing software is with the requirements in mind. I always think of the client and what they have requested. Even if a developer does good work, it doesn't always matter if it isn't what the client asked for. <br/>
<br />
**How do I approach developing programs?**<br />
OpenGL was extremely difficult for me to learn so I had to take a slightly different approach. One thing I did was read and watch tutorials from various sources. I also made sure to take breaks and look back with a fresh mind. <br />
<br />
**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**<br />
Computer Science can help me to look at things from a critical view and help aid in my ability to solve complex problems. While I may not use OpenGL in the future, it helped a lot with learning troubleshooting skills and trying new things. <br />
